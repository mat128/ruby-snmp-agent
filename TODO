* Handle exceptions thrown by plugins deeper earlier; they currently bubble
  up to the main handler loop and it confuses things terribly, resulting in
  a timeout from the client.
  
* Possibly rework the add_plugin_dir handler (or provide another interface)
  that is more explicit in it's registration functionality.  I've decided
  that the implicit way I'm going it now is a bit half-assed, isn't very
  clear to plugin writers, isn't idiomatic, and isn't very friendly to more
  complex plugins that might like to define their own classes and methods.

* Implement a request-forwarding proxy for defined subsets of the OID tree. 
  Something like agent.add_proxy('1.3.6.1.4.1.2021', 'localhost', 16161)
  should do nicely.

* Add a real-world agent binary for those who just want a simple,
  stand-alone SNMP agent to replace net-snmpd.

* Allow the restriction of requests based on community name.

* Support symbolic OID specification in add_plugin -- that is, allow you to
  specify a MIB name rather than a giant opaque collection of numbers.  I
  suspect it may already be available, but it'll need to be tested.
