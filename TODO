* Implement a request-forwarding proxy for defined subsets of the OID tree. 
  Something like agent.add_proxy('1.3.6.1.4.1.2021', 'localhost', 16161)
  should do nicely.

* Add a real-world agent binary for those who just want a simple,
  stand-alone SNMP agent to replace net-snmpd.

* Allow the restriction of requests based on community name.

* Support symbolic OID specification in add_plugin -- that is, allow you to
  specify a MIB name rather than a giant opaque collection of numbers.  I
  suspect it may already be available, but it'll need to be tested.
