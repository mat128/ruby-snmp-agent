* Provide "sparse" arrays (probably by permitting hashes in plugins as well as
	arrays)

* Support GetNext requests

* Allow the restriction of requests based on community name

* Handle the case where there are no plugins specified (bomb on startup?)

* TEST CASE: GetNext on the last entry in a plugin should return the first
	entry in the next plugin
