* Allow the restriction of requests based on community name

* Implement a simple mechanism whereby pre-written plugins can
  easily be dropped in (without having to explicitly pass the
  code block into the agent).

* Support symbolic OID specification in add_plugin (I suspect it
  may already be available, but it'll need to be tested)
